# ShinyDB
This repo contains shiny apps that I have been working on while learning shiny workflows and syntax. 
For apps that allow one to upload or manipulate files, I assume that there is a configuration file calles `config.json` 
which is located in the user directory, so it can be called with `read_lines` and parsed with `jsonlite::fromJSON`.
